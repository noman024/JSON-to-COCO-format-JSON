## **Python script for converting 4 JSON files to COCO format**


This Python script is designed to take four individual JSON files from a directory and convert them into a single COCO format file. The COCO format is commonly used in computer vision applications and provides a standard way of organizing and annotating image data.

Requirements
To run this script, you will need the following installed on your system:

Python 3
NumPy
OpenCV
Usage
To use this script, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
Place the four input JSON files in a directory named data within the same directory as the Python script.
Run the script using the following command: python script_name.py
The output COCO format file will be saved in the same directory as the Python script.
Example
Suppose you have four JSON files named file1.json, file2.json, file3.json, and file4.json that you want to convert to COCO format. Here's how you would use this script:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
Create a directory named data within the same directory as the Python script.
Place the four input JSON files in the data directory.
Run the script using the following command: python script_name.py
The output COCO format file will be saved in the same directory as the Python script.
